Updated at the end of every session. Only record what a build actually did.

## 2026-10-16: Phase 0 complete

- **Works:** `just configure-release` without a ROM succeeds on Windows 11 (VS 2022 17.14,
  clang-cl 19.1.5, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja), about 2 minutes. It builds the ReXGlue SDK from the
  submodule source tree and prints the codegen steps, because `generated/default/sources.cmake`
  does not exist yet.
- **Phase 1 started:** disc extracted into `rom/` (2,474 files) and the `default.xex` hash recorded:
  version `0.0.0.26`, PAL, title `415608E9`. The XEX check now accepts this dump.
- **Codegen works** (release preset, about 3 minutes): 445 files, 232 MB of C++ in
  `generated/default/`. It needed two things:
  - `amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll` on `PATH`. `rexruntime.dll` imports it, but it is not copied next to
    the codegen tool, so `rexglue.exe` exited with 0xC0000135 (DLL not found). The `justfile` now
    adds FidelityFX's `PrebuiltSignedDLL` folder to `PATH`.
  - One `[functions]` entry: `0x82F60BD8`, reached only by a tail call from `0x82515C04`. That was the
    only analysis error in the whole XEX.
- **Codegen warnings:** 20 × "Unexpected float16_4 pack instruction", all between `0x82F87E84` and
  `0x82F88A10` (one small region, likely vector/half-float packing in a library). Watch for wrong
  vertex data or graphics glitches that trace back there.
- **Not tried yet:** compiling the generated code, running.
- **Warnings from the configure** (7, none fatal):
  - FidelityFX (pulled in by the SDK): an object file directory under `out/build/` is 194
    characters long; CMake warns the build "may not work correctly" (limit 250). The repository sits
    in a deep folder. If the first build fails on long paths, use a shorter build or checkout path.
    Tracked as an issue in Phase 1.
  - The rest are upstream CMake policy/version notices in the SDK and FidelityFX.
- **Placeholders:** the hooks in `src/hooks/` are disabled Giants templates; `ultrawide_fov`,
  `ultrawide_hud` and `skip_intro` are commented out in the settings examples.
- **Known bugs:** none recorded.
- **Next:** first full build of the generated code (`just regen-release`).
