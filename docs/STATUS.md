Updated at the end of every session. Only record what a build actually did.

## 2026-10-16: Phase 0 complete

- **Works:** `just configure-release` without a ROM succeeds on Windows 11 (VS 2022 17.14,
  clang-cl 19.1.5, CMake 4.4.4, Ninja), about 2 minutes. It builds the ReXGlue SDK from the
  submodule source tree and prints the codegen steps, because `generated/default/sources.cmake`
  does not exist yet.
- **Not tried yet:** codegen, compiling, running. No ROM in `rom/`.
- **Warnings from the configure** (7, none fatal):
  - FidelityFX (pulled in by the SDK): an object file directory under `out/build/` is 194
    characters long; CMake warns the build "may not work correctly" (limit 250). The repository sits
    in a deep folder. If the first build fails on long paths, use a shorter build or checkout path.
    Tracked as an issue in Phase 1.
  - The rest are upstream CMake policy/version notices in the SDK and FidelityFX.
- **Placeholders:** `docs/game/default.xex.sha256` is all zeros, so the XEX check rejects every dump
  until Phase 1. The hooks in `src/hooks/` are disabled Giants templates; `ultrawide_fov`,
  `ultrawide_hud` and `skip_intro` are commented out in the settings examples.
- **Known bugs:** none recorded.
- **Next:** Phase 1, starting with extracting the disc and recording the `default.xex` hash.
